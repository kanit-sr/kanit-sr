# Hi, I'm Hunter 👋

I'm a Computer Engineering student at Chulalongkorn University, passionate about building clean, efficient systems and learning how things work at every level — from low-level logic to server-side development.

I'm currently focused on becoming a skilled **Back-End Developer**, starting with core programming, Git, and Node.js as I expand into full systems development.

## 🌱 Beyond Code

Outside of programming, I'm deeply curious and love exploring complex systems — whether through physics, creative writing, or Dungeons & Dragons worldbuilding.  
I believe imagination and logic go hand-in-hand — great engineers not only write code, but also craft stories and understand the deeper laws that shape our universe and the worlds we create.
